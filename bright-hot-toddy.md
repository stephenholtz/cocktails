Bright (orange) Hot Toddy
=========================
A smooth, tart and sweet hot toddy that leans a bit on the flavor from a good orange tea bag.

- 2 Bags orange spice tea (herbal or black both work)
- 1 1/2 oz Bourbon 
- 1 oz Lemon Juice
- 1 oz Honey
- 1/2 oz Drambuie
- 1/4 oz Port
- 1 stick of cinnamon

Brew 2 bags of tea in 1 1/2 cups of boiling water 212F for 3 mins (or at the lower end of the suggested brew time). Add in the remaining ingredients and stir with the cinnamon stick.
