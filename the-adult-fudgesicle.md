The Adult Fudgesicle
====================

In spite of the awful name this is a very nice summer (or winter?) dessert cocktail. The ginger beer, egg, creme de cacao base works with a lot of other sipping liquors. Bourbon is the natural first choice, however.

- 3 oz Flat Ginger Beer
- 1 oz Creme de Cacao
- 1 oz Ouzo or, Gantous and Abou Raad Arak Liqueur (my preference)
- 1 Large Egg (whole egg)
- 1 oz Bourbon
- Pinch Lemon Zest 

Pour all ingredients except lemon zest over ice and shake hard for at least 30s. Be sure the ginger beer is flat, or you'll have a real mess on your hands. Strain into a coupe glass and shave/grind Lemon Zest over top (for other liquors pick the appropriate aromatic to deposit on top of the foam e.g. nutmeg, cinnamon, lemon zest, ...).
