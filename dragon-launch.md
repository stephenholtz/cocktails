Dragon Launch
--- 
This cocktail is meant to resemble the colors of the different stages of the recent (succesful!) crewed SpaceX launch. 

To get the Dragon capsule with crew into orbit, SpaceX uses a two stage rocket called the [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9). Both stages use a liquid oxygen (LOX) and refined kerosene (RP-1) fuel in their [Merlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Merlin) engine. Stage 1 uses a "sea-level" Merlin engine, Stage 2 uses a space-optimized "vacuum" Merlin engine. Both stages are ignited using TEA-TEB ignition fluid. After the first two stages, the Draco thrusters on the dragon capsule take over to perform a series of phasing burns. Draco thrusters use a hypergolic propellant, which does not requrie igntion, consisting of monomethyl hydrazine fuel and a nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer.

This means in order there will be an:
- **green** ignition (TEA-TEB), 
- **yellow** propulsion burn (LOX RP-1), 
- **green** ignition (TEA-TEB), 
- **yellow** propulsion burn (LOX RP-1),
- **orange** phasing burns (hypergolic) x5
