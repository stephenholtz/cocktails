Dragon Launch
--- 
This cocktail is meant to resemble the colors of the different stages of the recent (succesful!) crewed SpaceX launch. 

To get the Dragon capsule with crew into orbit, SpaceX uses a two stage rocket called the [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9). Both stages use a liquid oxygen (LOX) and refined kerosene (RP-1) fuel in their [Merlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Merlin) engine. Stage 1 uses a "sea-level" Merlin engine, Stage 2 uses a space-optimized "vacuum" Merlin engine. Both stages are ignited using TEA-TEB ignition fluid. After the first two stages, the [Draco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Draco) thrusters on the Dragon capsule take over to perform a series of phasing burns. Draco thrusters use a hypergolic propellant, which does not requrie igntion, consisting of monomethyl hydrazine fuel and a nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer.

This means in order there will be:
- **green** ignition (TEA-TEB), 
- **yellow-white** propulsion burn (LOX RP-1), 
- **green** ignition (TEA-TEB), 
- **yellow-white** propulsion burn (LOX RP-1),
- **red-orange** phasing burns (hypergolic) x5

Since getting more than 2 layers is already challenging, we are going to make a simplified green->yellow/white->red/orange cocktail:
- For the green, freeze a puck of crushed green flavorice mixed with a bit of green chartreuse (it tastes surprisingly good together). Once it is solid, pack it into the bottom of a highball glass.
- For the yellow-white, pack shaved ice and pour in 4:1 pineapple juice:blanco tequila very carefully
- To keep the next layer separate for a short while, squirt a layer of simple syrup on the packed ice from the yellow-white.
- For the red-orange, carefully add more shaved ice and slowly carefully pour 1:1 aperol:orange juce

Serve with a long spoon, and give it a swirl before drinking.
