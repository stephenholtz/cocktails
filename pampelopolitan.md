pampelopolitan
====

Pampelmousse + Cosmopolitan = Pampelopolitan. A bit of a smoother version of a cosmopolitan with a more balanced citrus profile (aka: I just noticed thought the cosmo already tasted a bit like grapefruit).

- 1.5 oz vodka (good, non-citron)
- 1 oz 100% cranberry juice (not cocktail)
- 3/4 oz orange triple sec (Cointreau)
- 1/2 oz grapefruit liquor (Giffard Cr√®me de Pamplemousse rose)
- 1/2 oz fresh-squeezed lime juice
- 1/2 oz simple syrup

Shake hard in ice, and double strain. Serve up if you're packin' coupes.

*TODO: add documentation for a clarified and carbonated version: pampelobubbliatan.*
