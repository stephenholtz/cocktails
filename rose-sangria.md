Rosé Sangria
---
(under construction, just dumping old notes here for now)

- 1 750mL bottle _dry_ rose wine
- 2 cups of equal parts:
  - Fresh blueberries, gently bruised
  - Fresh sliced strawberries
  - Ripe peach or nectarine (cut to match strawberry slice size)
- 1/2 orange (also cut to match strawberry slice size)
- 3oz St. Germain liqueur
- 1oz Contrieu
- 1oz Bourbon

Combine all ingredients and mix well in a pitcher. Let steep in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. 

To serve, for each glass add 1/2 to 1 oz seltzer and stir with ice, adding fruit from the pitcher. Extrapolate to make the full pitcher serving ready.

Notes: 
- This requires a bit of adjustment for the rosé and fruit used, if using unexpectedly meh wine I have found sometimes a few oz of Lillet and seltzer/champagne can rescue a mediocre batch.
- It can very easily turn out far too sweet and that's hard to fix without making it too watery, so being conservative to start is a good idea.
- After a day in the refrigerator it becomes far sweeter, so correcting a batch for sweetness after a few hours should only be done if you plan of finishing it that day.
